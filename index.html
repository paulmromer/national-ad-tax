            Across the political spectrum, people are realizing that the digital advertising model pioneered by Google and Facebook threatens democracy. These firms know more about citizens of the world's democracies than the Stasi knew about East Germans. They do not need the coercive powers of a police state to exploit this knowledge. They adjust what people see and control by a thousand nudges and distractions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the United States, Google receives 18% of all spending on political advertising; Facebook controls another 59%. In a public conversation in the summer of 2019, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO and majority owner of Facebook, explained that his intention is for Facebook to be the global arbiter in the realm of political speech. It is the only player that can work "in partnership with intelligence agencies and election commissions around the world" on "election integrity" because it has built "unprecedented content systems" that are "more sophisticated than what a lot of governments have." 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I first became aware of Facebook's penetration into other political systems at a dinner in Chile where senior members of the ruling party described their reliance on Facebook's targeted political ads. I asked if they were uncomfortable with the fact that a foreign corporation under the unilateral control of a single person had so much influence on their elections. They dismissed this concern and said that what mattered was that they were so far ahead of the opposition party in using the powerful tools that Facebook had developed. They thought of Facebook as an arms dealer that would give them an advantage. They did not seem to recognize that Facebook does not sell political weapons; it rents them out and always remains in control. 
        </p>
        <h2><a name="defending">Defending Democracy</a></h2>
        <p>
            Although the founding principle of the United States was opposition to unchecked power, the current reaction to these powerful tech monopolies can best characterized as learned helplessness. "Forget about it Jake. It's the market."
        </p>
            
        <p> 
            There is, to be sure, a new impulse send antitrust enforcers out "round up all the usual suspects." I believe in second chances, but I'm not willing to bet the future of our political system on strategy that consists solely of giving them "do-over". In recent decades, antitrust policy failed because powerful entities who wanted it to fail had access to experts who understood how to ensure its failure.
        </p>

        <p>
            The battle to preserve democracy and freedom must be waged with the tools of political persuasion, and in this battle, the individuals that control  such powerful political weapons persuasion now have the advantage. Defenders of democracy must therefore be willing to innovate. Our traditional defenses have failed. It's time to play offense.
        </p>

        <p>
            Two years ago, I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/opinion/tax-facebook-google.html">outlined a strategy</a> for a flanking attack on the growing political power of the tech giants that could avoid the lawsuits where they routinely prevailed. It called for legislators to enanct
            <ol>
                <li>a progressive tax</li>
                <li>on revenue from</li>
                <li>digital adversing.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            All three elements are essential to this strategy. Progressivity can offset the increasing returns on investments in code of code that give bigger firms a competitive advantage. There is little ambiguity about the geographic source of revenue, so a tax on revenue precludes the well established corporate strategy of shifting income to low tax jurisdictions. (Income is the difference between revenue and expenses that can be located in different places, so there is an unavoidable ambiguity about where income is located.) Taxing  digital advertising encourages firms to switch to a less dangerous way of earning a return on the services that the firm provides. It purposely refrains from a broad attempt at reducing the economic harm from monopoly power in so many markets to focus our energies on the monopolies that threaten elections and political discourse.   
        </p>
        <p>
            As far as I can tell, no one disagrees that voters could get legislators to implement this type of tax. At the federal level, it would be an excise tax like the one that the Congress has imposed on tanning bed parlors. Nor do any credible voices dispute the claim that a sufficiently aggressive tax can create irresistible pressure for change. Firms will be able to reduce their tax bill by splitting in smaller independent companies or by shifting to the less dangerous type of business model that prevails in the markets that are socially beneficial -- buyers pay to get something from sellers and buyers who are unhappy with what a seller offers can take their business elsewhere.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Some people have argued that although we expect people to pay to get food or clothing, it would be "impossible" to get people to pay for a digital service. Yet in the market for such services, firms disparate as Microsoft, Netflix, Duolingo, and Substack have all found that people will pay for a service that they value. Moreover, these firms show that there is nothing intrinsically dangerous to society about the provision of digital services. The firms that rely on subscriptions or direct payments have no need for a surveillance system that tracks all online activity. They do not rely on turbocharged animosity to keep people online and so they see more information that the firm can control. They did not attack Apple for letting its customers choose whether to allow more digital tracking. They feel no need for a "supreme court" that corporate leaders can use to deflect responsibility for decisions that have far reaching political consequences. Their corporate leaders face no decisions with far reaching political consequences. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Google already offers several services that customers pay for, including a premium subscription for access to YouTube. All a tax on digital advertising needs to do is adjust the relative costs and benefits that Google and Facebook confront when they make the choice between subscription and advertising revenue and the costs and benefits from acquiring more firms versus spinning business units out as out independent firms. All it takes to force change along these two margins is a tax that is sufficiently aggressive. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next section, I'll start by proposing my version of an aggressive tax. Then I'll give you the chance to your own and see what incentives it creates for these two types of socially beneficial change. 
        </p>
        <h2><a name="modest">A Modest Proposal</a></h2>
        <p>
            A progressive tax must specify a "base" and a "schedule of rates". In this post, I'll assume that the base is the revenue that a firm collects from digital ads shown only to people in the United States. (In a subsequent post, I'll explore global versions of this type of tax.) 
        </p>
        <p>
            The table belows shows what I mean by aggressive. It describes a tax system with a marginal tax rate that exceeds 70% on advertising revenue above $60 billion per year.
        </p>
        <div class="lh-1" id="marginal-rate-table-default"></div>
        <p>
            To be clear about the mechanics of this type of schedule, consider what it would mean for Twitter and Microsoft. Twitter is projected to receive about $2.2 billion in digital advertising from the US during 2021. This falls in the first tax bracket where the tax rate is zero. Twitter would pay zero tax. The projections for Microsoft are that it will earn $6.7 billion from sales of digital advertising sales this year in the US . It would pay nothing on its first $5 billion in revenue, and 5% on the $1.7 billion that fall into the next tax bracket, hence would owe $0.1 billion to the government. Its average tax rate of 1.25% is its total tax payment of $0.1 billion divided by its ad revenue of $8 billion.
        </p>

        <p>   
            The blue line in the graph below shows how the average tax rate varies with revenue. It starts at zero, then increases steadily for revenue above $5 billion per year. Using published estimates of US digital advertising revenue for this year, the graph also shows the location of the firms that receive the most revenue from digital advertising in the US. Twitter is one of the unlabeled dots with an average tax rate equal to zero. Microsoft is the first labeled dot. The horizontal coordinate of its dot reflects its revenue of $6.7 billion. Its vertial coordinate shows its average tax rate. The number next to its lable shows the tax that it owes in billions of dollars. 
        </p>

        <div class="text-center">
            <img src="./graphs/fig-us-default.png" alt="Graph of average tax rates" />
        </div>

        <p>
            In this figure, the contrast between the large amount of tax that Google and Facebook would owe and the small amount that Microsoft and Amazon would owe highlights the effects of the choice of revenue from digital advertising as the base for the tax. Microsoft and Amazon collect far more revenue from other soucres.
        </p>
        <p>
           The graph shows that there is nothing "fair" about this ad tax. The intent has nothing to do with fairness, however it might be designed. This approach is as unfair as battlefield medicine. It prioritises the most urgent problem that can still be solved, in this case, defending democracy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the spirit of triage, this version of the tax does not try to limit the use of the advertising model by small firms. Other than Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, all the other players in this space -- Verizon Media (which owns Yahoo and Engaget), Hulu, Snapchat, Roku, Yelp, IAC (which owns such brands as Vimeo and Dotdash), Spotify, and Reddit -- would all pay no tax. They would face no immediate pressure for change, but would see that if they grow substantially, they will face pressure to change. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It leaves for later the question of how to address the challenge of the market power of such dominant tech firms as Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. If we preserve free political speach and democratic decision-making, we can address this challenge in the near future. If we don't, there will be no option. The status quo will prevail. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The only goal of this tax is escape from circumstances in which a couple of firms, controlled by a handful of people, have so much control over political speech by virtue of the secret information they possess about how to present specific bits of information to specific people to encourage specific beliefs and actions. 
        </p>
        <h2><a name="incentives">Incentives for Change</a></h2>
        <p>
            The next table shows one measure of the incentive for change that this tax system would create. It shows revenue for the industry as a whole and for the two dominant players, along with the tax that the entire industry and these firms would have to pay under this tax system, taking as given the history of revenue and the projections through 2023. One useful way to interpret the growing tax obligations that these two firms would confront is to think of them as the inducement that the government offers them for switching entirely to a model in which people pay for the services they receive.
        </p>  
        <div  class="lh-1" id="total-revenue-table-default"></div>

        <p>
            The other inducement requires a simple calculation. To use round numbers, Consider a firm with the annual advertising revenue of $60 billion. Under the tax system that I have proposed, it would owe roughly $22 billion in tax. It could split itself into two firms, each with revenue of $30 billion; in a very rough sense, this what would happen if Facebook were to spin out Instagram as an independent company. The two smaller firms would each face a lower average tax tax rate, so the total tax bill for the two of them together would be much lower, about $10 billion. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Reasonable people can differ about whether or not a $12 billion reduction in annual tax payments year would be a strong enough incentive for the owners of a firm to contemplate this type of split. I think it would, but suspect that many others would not. The point here is that the tax system needs to designed so that this incentive for firms to get smaller is sufficiently large. This, then, is the explanation for the high marginal tax rates in my tax schedule.  In the next section, you will have a chance to redo the tables and the graph for a tax system that caps the marginal tax rate at 50%. It would raise roughly the same $22 billion from a single firm with $60 billion in digital ad revenue, but under this less aggressive tax schedule, splitting itself in two would save only $7.5 billion per year. 
        </p>
    
        <h2><a name="trying">Trying a Different Tax Schedule</a></h2>
        <p>
            You can use this code window to rerun the calculations from the last section using a different tax system. If you leave the code as is and click Run (after the run button appears), the system you submit will be the one that is specified on the lines that are not commented out with the "#" symbol. It caps the marginal tax rate at 45% and makes up the lost revenue by reducing the size of the tax brackets. Click run and give it a try. (Note: If you are on a mobile device or using Safari as your browser, you will see the tables and numbers but you will not be able to see the updated graph. To see the graph, switch to a desktop computer that is running Firefox, Chrome, or Edge.)

        <p>
            One caution about this code, which is written in the language of Python. If you haven't encountered it before, it is important to know that part of why Python is so readable is that assigns meaning to the white space that indents some bit of code. One potentially surprising consequence of this unusual design choice is that if you add a space to the beginning of a valid line of code, Python will reject it. So if you delete a hash marker to activate a line of code, make sure you do not inadvertently add a starting blank space. It may also help to know that the code runs in the order specified by the line numbers, so active lines with bigger numbers will overwrite active lines that come before.
