            Across the political spectrum, people are realizing that the digital advertising model pioneered by Google and Facebook threatens democracy. These firms know more about citizens of the world's democracies than the Stasi knew about East Germans. They can exploit what they know without relying on the coercive power of a police state. By adjusting what people see, they exercise control by a thousand nudges.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the United States, Google receives 18% of all spending on political advertising; Facebook controls another 59%. In a public conversation in the summer of 2019, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO and majority owner of Facebook, explained that Facebook is the only candidate for the role of global arbiter for political discourse. It is the only organization that can work "in partnership with intelligence agencies and election commissions around the world" on "election integrity" because it has built "unprecedented content systems" that are "more sophisticated than what a lot of governments have." 
        </p>
        <p>
            I first learned about Facebook's penetration into the political dynamics of countries outside the US at a dinner in Chile where senior members of one of the ruling parties attributed their recent electoral success to their use of Facebook's targeted political ads. I asked if they were uncomfortable about the fact that a foreign corporation controlled by a single person could have so much influence on their elections. My question did not even seem to register. They told me that they were comfortable because they were far ahead of the opposition in understanding how to use the tools that Facebook was offering. They seemed to think of Facebook as an arms dealer to which they had preferential access. They did not seem to recognize that Facebook does not sell political weapons; it is a digital mercenary that is always the one with its fingers on the trigger. 
        </p>
        <h2><a name="antitrust">The Learned Helplessness of Antitrust Policy</a></h2>
        <p>
            Although the founding principle of the United States was opposition to unchecked power, the current reaction to the dominance of these two tech monopolies can best described as learned helplessness. The law and economics movement has been fostering this can't-do attitude for decades. "Forget about it Jake. It's the market." 
        </p>
        <p> 
            A new generation of judicial activists seems to be optimistic that  antitrust actions can still hold these firms in check. I do not understand the basis for this optimism. As far as I can tell, this new generation of activists are ignoring the signal that the Supreme Court sent when it use fact-free theorizing about platforms to overturn the trial and appeals court decisions in the case of Ohio v. American Express. If the Supreme Court is our last great hope for limiting corporate power, things truly are hopeless. We could spend the next 5 to ten years litigating cases against these firms while there revenue quadruples, only to be told by the court, "Forget about it Jake. It's a two-sided platform."
        </p>
        <h2><a name="offense">Playing Offense</a></h2>
        <p>
            Our defences have failed. It is time to start playing offense. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Two years ago, I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/opinion/tax-facebook-google.html">outlined a strategy</a> for a flanking attack on the growing political power of the tech giants that could avoid the lawsuits where they routinely prevailed. It called for legislators to enact a progressive tax on revenue from digital advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
            All three elements in this strategy are essential. Progressivity can offset the increasing returns on investments in code that give bigger firms an advantage over smaller rivals. Revenue is the right base for a tax because there is little ambiguity about where revenue is earned. This means that a tax that uses revenue as its base is not vulnerable to the well established corporate strategy of shifting income from high-tax to low-tax jurisdictions. Taxing only the revenue from digital advertising will encourage a firm to switch less dangerous ways to get paid for the the services it provides. 
        </p>
        <p>This tax is not a broad attack on all types of monopoly power. It focuses our energy on the monopolies that threaten our elections and our political and social discourse.
        </p>
        <p>
            As far as I can tell, everyone agrees that the Congress could adopt this type of tax. It would be an excise tax like the one that the legislators imposed on tanning bed parlors. No credible voices dispute the claim that a sufficiently aggressive tax can create irresistible pressure for the ad-tech giants to change how they operate. They will face pressure to their tax bill by splitting themselves into smaller independent companies or by shifting to the type of business model that prevails in markets that truly are socially beneficial -- one where buyers pay to get something from sellers and where buyers who are unhappy with what a seller offers can take their business elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Some people have argued that although people pay for clothing and cars, it would be "impossible" to get them to pay for digital services. Yet in the market for such services, firms as disparate as Microsoft, Netflix, Duolingo and Substack have found that people will pay for a digital service that they value. Moreover, these four subscription-based firms show that there is nothing intrinsically dangerous about the provision of digital services. These firms have no need for a surveillance system that tracks all online activity. None of these firms attacked Apple for letting its customers choose whether to allow more digital tracking. They do not rely on turbocharged animosity to keep people online and so they spend more time seeing what more information that the firm tries to feed them. They feel no need for a "supreme court" can deflect responsibility for corporate decisions that have far reaching political consequences. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Google already offers several services that customers pay for, including a premium subscription for access to YouTube. All a tax on digital advertising needs to do is adjust the relative costs and benefits that Google and Facebook confront when they make the choice between subscription and advertising revenue; and to adjust the costs and benefits that they receive from growing by acquisition versus shrinking by doing spin-outs. All it takes to force change along these two margins is a tax that is sufficiently aggressive. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next section, I'll propose my version of an aggressive tax. In the section that follows, I'll give you a chance to propose your own tax and see what incentives it creates for firms to move down these two socially beneficial paths. 
        </p>
        <h2><a name="modest">A Modest Proposal</a></h2>
        <p>
            A progressive tax must specify a "base" and a "schedule of rates". In this post, I'll assume that the base is the revenue that a firm collects from digital ads shown only to people in the United States. (In a subsequent post, I'll explore global versions of this type of tax.) 
        </p>
        <p>
            The table belows shows what I mean by aggressive. It describes a tax system with a marginal tax rate that exceeds 70% on advertising revenue above $60 billion per year.
        </p>
        <div class="lh-1" id="marginal-rate-table-default"></div>
        <p>
            To be clear about the mechanics of this type of schedule, consider what it would mean for Twitter and Microsoft. In 2021, Twitter is projected to receive about $2.2 billion for digital ads displayed in the US. This amount falls into the first tax bracket where the tax rate is zero. Twitter would pay zero tax. The projection for Microsoft is that it will earn $6.7 billion for displaying digital ads in the US. Under this tax schedule, it would pay nothing on the first $5 billion in revenue, and 5% on the $1.7 billion that falls into the second tax bracket, hence would owe $0.1 billion to the government. Its average tax rate of 1.25% is its total tax payment of $0.1 billion divided by its ad revenue of $8 billion.
        </p>
        <p>   
            The blue line in the graph below shows how the average tax rate varies with revenue. It starts at zero, then increases steadily for revenue above $5 billion per year. Using published estimates of US digital advertising revenue for this year, the graph also shows the location of the firms that receive the most revenue from digital advertising in the US. Twitter is one of the unlabeled dots with an average tax rate equal to zero. Microsoft is the first labeled dot. The horizontal coordinate of its dot reflects its revenue of $6.7 billion. Its vertial coordinate shows its average tax rate. The number next to its lable shows the tax that it owes in billions of dollars. 
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img src="./graphs/fig-us-default.png" alt="Graph of average tax rates" />
        </div>
        <p>
            In this figure, the contrast between the large amount of tax that Google and Facebook would owe and the small amount that Microsoft and Amazon would owe highlights the effects of the choice of revenue from digital advertising as the base for the tax. Microsoft and Amazon collect far more revenue from other sources.
        </p>
        <p>
           The graph shows that there is nothing "fair" about this particular tax. The circumstances call for the triage mentality of battlefield medicine. This tax focuses on the urgent challenge of preserving free political speech and democratic decision-making where action now could still make a difference. If this effort succeeds, our democracy can address the other monopolies in the near future. If it doesn't, effort devoted to limiting the other monopolies will have no effect. Best one can hope for is that the status quo prevails and that monopolies stop accumulating additional power.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the spirit of triage, this version of the tax does not try to limit the use of the advertising model by small firms. Other than Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, all the other players in this space -- Verizon Media (which owns Yahoo and Engaget), Hulu, Snapchat, Roku, Yelp, IAC (which owns such brands as Vimeo and Dotdash), Spotify and Reddit -- would pay no tax. They would face no immediate pressure for change, but would at least see that there are limits on the possibility of growth via this model alone. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The only goal of this tax is push the firms that control digital advertising down the two paths that will reduce their power -- the path toward subscriptions and the path toward competition between a large number of smaller firms.
        </p>
        <h2><a name="incentives">Incentives for Change</a></h2>
        <p>
            The next table shows one measure of the incentive for change that this tax system would create. It shows revenue for the industry as a whole and for the two dominant players, along with the tax that the entire industry and these firms would have to pay under this tax system, taking as given the history of revenue and the projections through 2023. One useful way to interpret the growing tax obligations that these two firms would confront is to think of them as the inducement that the government offers them for switching entirely to a model in which people pay for the services they receive.
        </p>  
        <div  class="lh-1" id="total-revenue-table-default"></div>
        <p>
            The other inducement requires a simple calculation. Consider a firm with US digital advertising revenue of $60 billion per year. Under the tax system that I have described so far, this firm would owe about $22 billion in tax. It could split itself into two firms, each with revenue of $30 billion; roughly speaking, this what would happen if Facebook were to spin out Instagram as an independent company. The two smaller firms would each face a lower average tax rate, so the total tax bill would fall from $22 billion to $10 billion. 
        </p>
        <p>
            These two numbers capture the magnitude of the incentives that this tax system would create. A shift to a subscription model would save $22 billion per year in tax. Staying with the advertising model but splitting into two independent firms would save $12 billion per year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reasonable people can differ about the response that these incentives will trigger. Some people claim that that a tax bill for $22 billon would destroy both Google and Facebook. I find this hard to believe. If Google and Facebook each had to give up $22 billion from their 2021 earnings on ad sales in the US, their net receipts this year would be roughly equal to their total receipts in 2018. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            The other concern is that $22 billion per year would not be enough to get these firms to give up on the advertising model. Given the steps that Google is taking and the success that other firms have had with the subscription model, it seems plausible to me that $22 billion per year would be enough to trigger a switch. But if not, the backup incentive -- $12 billion per year for splitting a company in half -- comes into play. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I can now explain the motivation for the high marginal rates. In the next section, you will have a chance to recalculate the results presented above for any tax system you want to consider. If you click the Run button below the window with the code without making any changes, you can try a tax schedule that the collects the same total revenue of about $22 billion per year from a firm with $60 billion in revenue and which caps the marginal tax rate at 50%. As you will see, the difference is that under this alternative, the splitting the firm in two would save only $7.5 billion per year instead of the $12 billion in tax savings that the aggressive tax schedule would offer.  
        </p>
        <h2><a name="trying">Trying a Different Tax Schedule</a></h2>
        <p>
            You can use the code window below submit a different tax system and redo all the calculations. If you leave the in the window as is and just click the Run button, the tax system you submit will one that is specified on lines 10 and 11, the lines that do not start with the comment symbol "#". It caps the marginal tax rate at 50% and makes up the lost revenue by reducing the size of its tax brackets. Click the button and give it a try. Then edit the code in the window and try another.

                <li>If you haven't encountered Python before, be forewarned that one of the conventions that makes Python so readable is that it assigns meaning to white space that indents blocks of code.

So if you delete some hash markers to activate some of the sample lines of code, check to make sure that you have not inadvertently add a initial blank space. </li>

        <h2><a name="nextPost">The Next Post</a></h2>
            <p>
                The next post in this series will reconsider the design of the ad tax that is based on worldwide digital advertising revenue. The gist of this analysis is that the United States stands to gain little from this revision, but it would confer a significant benefit on the other democracies in the world. 
            </p>
        <h2><a name="closing">Closing Questions</a></h2>
            <p>
                The most important lesson from economics is that people respond to big incentives. The owners of Google and Facebook have a huge incentive to make sure that the tax proposed here is never adopted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So if your initial reaction was that Google and Facebook would never use the advertising platforms and secret data that they control to influence the public debate on an urgent policy question, ask yourself these questions: 
                <ol>
                    <li>How confident am I that either of these platforms would accept paid political ads that promote the ad tax outlined here?</li>
                    <li>If one of these platforms did accept such ads, how confident would I be that they would serve these ads in a neutral way and treat them like any other paid political advertisement?</li>
                    <li>After the fact, how could anyone verify whether such ads were in fact delivered as promised?</li>
                </ol>
